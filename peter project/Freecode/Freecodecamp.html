  <p>Today we start from the begining. HTML on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/</a>! The foundation of web development </p>
  <h2>Basic HTML and HTML5</h2>
  <p>HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.<br>In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements â€” the building blocks of any webpage.</p>

  <h3>Say Hello to HTML Elements</h3>

  <p>Welcome to freeCodeCamp's HTML coding challenges. These will walk you through web development step-by-step.First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML. You can edit code in your code editor, which is embedded into this web page.Do you see the code in your code editor that says <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</code>? That's an HTML element.</p>
  <p>To pass the test on this challenge, change your h1 element's text to say Hello World</p>
  <form>
    <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    </textarea>
    <a href="test1.html">TEST</a>
  </form>
  </article>

  <article class="headline">
    <h3>Headline with the h2 Element</h3>
    <i><time datetime="2021-29-10">Oct 29th, 2021</time></i>
    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/headline-with-the-h2-element">Source</a>
    <p>Over the next few lessons, we'll build an HTML5 cat photo web app piece-by-piece.<br><br>The h2 element you will be adding in this step will add a level two heading to the web page.<br>
    <br>This element tells the browser about the structure of your website. h1 elements are often used for main headings, while h2 elements are generally used for subheadings. There are also h3, h4, h5 and h6 elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.<br>
    <br>Add an h2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" h1 element.</p>
    <form>
      <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
      </textarea>
      <a href="test2.html">TEST</a>
    </form>
  </article>

  <article class="Inform">
  <h3>Inform with the Paragraph Element</h3>
  <i><time datetime="2021-29-10">Oct 29th, 2021</time></i>
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/inform-with-the-paragraph-element">Source</a>
  <p>p elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. p is short for "paragraph".<br><br>You can create a paragraph element like this:<br><br><code>&lt;p&gt;I'm a p tag!&lt;/p&gt;</code>Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text Hello Paragraph.<br><br>Note: As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> and not <code>&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;.</code></p>

  <form>
    <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/fill-in-the-blank-with-placeholder-text">Source</a>
    <p>Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.<br><br>Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.<br><br>Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called "kitty ipsum" text.<br><br>Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: <b>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</b></p>
    <form>
      <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">

    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/uncomment-html">Source</a>
    <p>Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.<br>Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely. Comments in HTML start with  &lt;!-- and end with a -- &gt;<br>Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.</p>
    <form>
      <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

  <h3>Comment out HTML</h3>

  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/comment-out-html">Source</a>
  <p>Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use &lt!-- and to end a comment, you need to use --&gt;

  Here you'll need to end the comment before your h2 element begins.

  Comment out your h1 element and your p element, but not your h2 element.</p>

  <form>
  <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
  <!--<h1>Hello world</h1> -->
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <!--<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p> -->

  <h3>Delete HTML Elements</h3>
  <i><time datetime="2021-29-10">Oct 29th, 2021</time></i>
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/delete-html-elements">Source</a>
  <p>Our phone doesn't have much vertical space.

  Let's remove the unnecessary elements so we can start building our CatPhotoApp.

  Delete your h1 element so we can simplify our view.</p>

  <form>
  <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

  <h3>Introduction to HTML5 Elements</h3>
  <i><time datetime="2021-29-10">Oct 29th, 2021</time></i>
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/introduction-to-html5-elements">Source</a>
  <p>HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.<br>

    <br>These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.<br>

    <br>Example usage, a main element with two child elements nested inside it:</p>

  <form>
    <textarea name="text" cols="25" rows="5">
  <main> 
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
  </main>
    </textarea>
  </form>

  <p><b>Note:</b> Many of the new HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in the Applied Accessibility section.</p>
  <p>Create a second p element with the following kitty ipsum text: Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.<br><br>

  Then, create a main element and nest only the two p elements inside the main element.</p>

  <form>
  <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  </textarea>
  <a href="test6.html">TEST</a>
  </form>

  <h3>Add Images to Your Website</h3>
  <i><time datetime="2021-29-10">Oct 29th, 2021</time></i>
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/add-images-to-your-website">Source</a>
  <p>You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute.<br>

    <br>An example of this would be:<br>

    <br>&lt;img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg"&gt;
  Note that img elements are self-closing.<br>

  <br>All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.<br>

  <br>Note: If the image is purely decorative, using an empty alt attribute is a best practice.<br>

  <br>Ideally the alt attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.<br>

  <br>Let's add an alt attribute to our img example above:<br>

  <br>&lt;img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg" alt="A business cat wearing a necktie."	&gt;<br>
  Let's try to add an image to our website:<br>

  <br>Within the existing main element, insert an img element before the existing p elements.<br>

  <br>Now set the src attribute so that it points to the url https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg<br>

  <br>Finally, don't forget to give your img element an alt attribute with applicable text.</p>

  <form>
  <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="Cat with at tie"
  <p> Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
    </textarea>
    <a href="test7.html">TEST</a>
  </form>

  <h3>Link to External Pages with Anchor Elements</h3>
  <i><time datetime="2021-31-10">Oct 31st, 2021</time></i>
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-external-pages-with-anchor-elements">Source</a>

  <p>You can use a (anchor) elements to link to content outside of your web page.<br>

    <br>a elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. They also need anchor text. Here's an example:<br>
    
    <br>&lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"&gt; this links to freecodecamp.org<br>
    <br>Then your browser will display the text this links to freecodecamp.org as a link you can click. And that link will take you to the web address https://www.freecodecamp.org.<br>
    
    <br>Create an a element that links to https://www.freecatphotoapp.com and has "cat photos" as its anchor text.</p>

    <form>
      <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="12">
      <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
      <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="Cat with at tie"
      <p> Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
      <a href="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com">cat photos</a>
        </textarea>
        <a href="test8.html">TEST</a>
      </form>

  <h3>Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements</h3>
  <i><time datetime="2021-31-10">Oct 31st, 2021</time></i>
  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-internal-sections-of-a-page-with-anchor-elements">Source</a>
  <p>a anchor elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.<br>

    <br>To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.<br>
    
    <br>Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:</p>

    <p>&lt;a href="#contacts-header">Contacts&lt;/a&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts &lt;/h2&gt;</p>

    <p>When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts heading element.</p>

      <p>Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to "#footer" and the text from cat photos to Jump to Bottom.</p>
      
      <p>Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.</p>
      
      <p>Then add an id attribute with a value of footer to the &lt;footer&gt; element at the bottom of the page.</p>


  <form>
  <textarea name="text" cols="150" rows="30">
  <h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

  <article>
    <p>
      Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.<br>This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript, which we'll learn about later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current value of the href attribute is a link that points to "https://www.freecatphotoapp.com". Replace the href attribute value with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.<br>For example: href="#"
